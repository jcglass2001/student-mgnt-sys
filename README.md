# Student Management System

## Overview

The Student Management System is a console-based application developed in C++ that allows users to manage student records. It provides functionalities to add, remove, display, and save student data to CSV files. This project serves as a practical exercise to refresh my knowledge of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts and features in C++.

## Features

- **Add Student**: Enter student details such as ID, name, age, and grade.
- **Remove Student**: Remove a student record using the unique student ID.
- **List Students**: Display a list of all registered students.
- **Save to CSV**: Save student data to a CSV file for persistent storage.
- **Load from CSV**: Load student data from existing CSV files.
- **User-Friendly Menu**: An interactive menu to navigate through the options.

## Technologies Used

- C++
- Standard Template Library (STL)
- File I/O
- C++17 (for filesystem support)
